Sprint Retrospective Report

Main problems
The main problem in this third sprint was a little lack of confrontation due to the holidays.

Good aspects
We were able to complete all tasks left undone from the previous sprint and integrate all others planned features. The use of GitHub and all other tools reached a good level of knowledge. A perfect usage of pair-programming with the rotation of the members.
