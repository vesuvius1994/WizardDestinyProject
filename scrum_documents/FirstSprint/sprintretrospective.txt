First Sprint Retrospective Report

Main problems
Lack of communication due to inexperience and unknowledge of how to approach a game project and development. Hence, the creation of the game architecture resulted challenging.

Good aspects
The result of the spike solution led us to produce a good architecture able to represent the solution to our problem.

Future Improvements
As we now have clearer view of the problem and communication problems are known, the workload can be managed more efficiently among all team members.
